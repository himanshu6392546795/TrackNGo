🚗 Fleet Management System

📌 Project Overview

The Fleet Management System is an enterprise-grade solution developed to streamline and digitize the management of company-owned vehicles. This internal Infosys application empowers fleet administrators to monitor vehicle status, track assignments, log maintenance activities, and manage driver schedules—all within a centralized iOS app interface.

This project was part of a digital transformation initiative aiming to reduce manual tracking, improve operational efficiency, and ensure real-time availability of fleet data for better decision-making.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: Swift, UIKit, Storyboards
Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Backend: Supabase
Database: CoreData (local caching)
Tools: Xcode, Jira, Git
